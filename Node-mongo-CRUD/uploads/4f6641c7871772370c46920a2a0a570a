Dear Network,
I'm looking for an internship or a job as a Junior Frontend Developer.
I already have some experience in something simple, as HTML/CSS, a bit of JS, and learning React now.
I'm open for propositions, which will allow me to become a Full-Stack Developer in nearest future :)
Thank you for all recommendations and propositions.


Hi everyone - I am looking for a new role and would appreciate your support. Thank you in advance for any connections, advice, or opportunities you can offer. #OpenToWork
